# Welcome world and me!

Today (10.Augsut 2020) I will launch this project = website.
If anyone ever will read this, I will quickly catch you up on what will happen on this website and what you can find here or not.

**Goal:** I am struggeling to keep information in my (long-time) memory, so on this website I will write down the knowledge I have gained on a day/week. 
This might just be a word but could be a whole topic. 
So for you as a reader, you can get the chance to gain some random knowledge - some might be of more use than others.
Hereby, the goal is not to be like a newspaper but more like an individual trying to learn something for her life.

Please feel free to share articles, websites etc. which helped you to broaden your horizon.

_This blog will not be about myself as a person but more of my interests._

Furthermore, I enjoy when people like my food, so I might post also some baking/cookin receipes. But this is just a side thing.

### What I have learnt today: Day 1
